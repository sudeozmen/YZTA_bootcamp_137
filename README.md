# 📝 1st Sprint Report – MentalTrack

**Sprint Duration:** June 30 – July 6  
**Team:** MentalTrack Development Team  
**Sprint Goal:** Define the core idea, team structure, and technology stack of the project. No coding was planned during this sprint.

---

## ✅ What We Achieved

### 🤝 Team Introduction & Role Sharing
We held our first meetings and got to know each other. Each team member shared their strengths, and preliminary roles were assigned (e.g., frontend, backend, documentation).

### 💡 Project Idea Finalized
We decided to build **MentalTrack**, an AI-powered emotional journal where users speak about their day and receive emotional analysis and personalized feedback from a large language model (LLM).

### 🧠 Problem Definition
Mental health and emotional awareness are often overlooked. MentalTrack aims to help users express their daily emotions through voice and receive meaningful AI feedback in return.

### 🧪 Selected Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (simple, fast deployment)  
- **Speech-to-Text:** Google STT (via SpeechRecognition)  
- **AI Analysis:** Gemini API (Google Generative AI)  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Environment Management:** `.env`, `python-dotenv`  
- **Dependency Management:** `requirements.txt`  

---

## 📅 Daily Scrum Summary
We held daily sync-ups using Google Meet.  
Key discussion points included:
- Clarifying project scope and MVP boundaries  
- Aligning on technology (Streamlit, Gemini, STT)  
- Assigning first tasks for next sprint

## 📌 Sprint Board Updates
We used Trello to track and manage our sprint progress.

**Board Structure:**
- **Backlog:** Feature ideas, inspirations  
- **Sprint 1:** Role sharing, idea discussion, tech stack research  
- **Done:** All sprint 1 goals completed  


## 🔢 Estimated Story Points (Sprint 1)

| Task                         | Story Points |
|------------------------------|--------------|
| Team structure & roles       | 3            |
| Finalize idea                | 5            |
| Define tech stack            | 5            |
| Write report/documentation   | 2            |

**Total Estimated Points:** **15**

---

## 🧠 Estimation Logic
We used **Fibonacci-based story points** to reflect effort and complexity:
- **1:** trivial  
- **3:** small (1 hour)  
- **5:** medium (1–2 hours)  
- **8+:** larger or ambiguous, needs discussion

Since this sprint was planning-focused, all estimations were based on non-coding effort.

## 🔁 Sprint Retrospective

### ✅ What went well:
- Active and respectful communication
- Reaching alignment on vision and roles

### ⚠️ What could improve:
- Idea refinement required multiple iterations
- Coordination was slightly delayed due to different schedules

### 💡 Suggestions for Next Sprint:

- Encourage async updates to reduce sync load  
- Begin planning for basic UI and microphone integration

---

## 🚀 Goals for Sprint 2
- Set up initial project directory and GitHub repository  
- Implement basic Streamlit UI  
- Integrate microphone input and speech recognition  
- Configure Gemini API key and `.env` environment  
- Generate first AI feedback from sample voice input  

---

## 🔖 Notes
This sprint focused on planning, communication, and scope definition. Although no code was written, a clear foundation was established for development in Sprint 2.
