# 🏁 1st Sprint Report – MentalTrack  
*Sprint Duration:* June 30 – July 6  
*Team:* MentalTrack Development Team  
*Sprint Goal:* Define the core idea, team structure, and technology stack of the project. No coding was planned during this sprint.

## ✅ What We Achieved

### 🤝 Team Introduction & Role Sharing  
We held our first meetings and got to know each other. Each team member shared their strengths, and preliminary roles were assigned (e.g., frontend, backend, documentation).

### 💡 Project Idea Finalized  
We decided to build *MentalTrack*, an AI-powered emotional journal where users speak about their day and receive emotional analysis and personalized feedback from a large language model (LLM).

### 🧠 Problem Definition  
Mental health and emotional awareness are often overlooked. MentalTrack aims to help users express their daily emotions through voice and receive meaningful AI feedback in return.

### 🧪 Selected Tech Stack  
- *Frontend:* Streamlit (simple, fast deployment)  
- *Speech-to-Text:* Google STT (via SpeechRecognition)  
- *AI Analysis:* Gemini API (Google Generative AI)  
- *Language:* Python  
- *Environment Management:* .env, python-dotenv  
- *Dependency Management:* requirements.txt

### 🧭 Sprint Planning and Timeline  
We drafted a high-level timeline with weekly sprints:  
- *Sprint 2:* Begin basic application structure (UI + STT + AI feedback)  
- *Sprint 3:* Add enhancements, testing, and user experience improvements  
- *Sprint 4:* Final polish, documentation, and deployment
